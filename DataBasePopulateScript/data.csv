Michelin Bib Gourmand Tempura,Tempura Kakiage Yukimura,Cherry Blossom Street,,"A 5 day Seoul itinerary: Day 5 Fifth day is in the Hongdae area. I�ve chosen activities that locals often enjoy. Before heading to Hongdae, let�s start by visiting Hongjecheon. This place, where an artificial waterfall was recently created, has become a popular spot attracting many visitors. The artificial waterfall is impressive, and behind it, a small hill is covered with numerous blooming flowers, making it a great place to enjoy spring blossoms. After that, we�ll move on to Mangwon Market. Here, you can enjoy some local snacks or have lunch at one of the many small restaurants in Mangwon-dong. After lunch, we�ll proceed to Yeonnamdong, located near Hongdae. Yeonnamdong, adjacent to Hongdae, is filled with trendy restaurants and cafes. Don�t miss walking along Gyeongui Line Forest Park. When you pass Hongdae Station, there�s a charming railway track. Next, we�ll stroll along Hongdae Street. In the afternoon, there are less crowds, making it a perfect time for cafe hopping or visiting street fashion stores for some shopping. Moving on to Hapjeong, which is known as a local gathering place with plenty of delicious restaurants and cafes. I recommend having dinner here. After that, in the Mangwon area, there is a street adorned with cherry blossoms. It�s beautiful during the day, but the evening lighting adds an extra charm, making it more enchanting at night. Following that, walk on Hongdae Street in the evening. Although you walked through Hongdae Street in the afternoon, the atmosphere changes in the evening. Many people come out for busking, street food stalls emerge, and the place becomes livlier. ?? Hongjecheon ?? Mangwon Market ?? Yeonnamdong ?? Hongdae ?? Hapjeong ?? Mangwon Cherry Blossom Street ??
